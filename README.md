Project Title:
Calculator-Java

Description:
A simple calculator application built with Java Swing, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) and basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Includes error handling for division by zero.

Features:
Graphical interface using Java Swing
Buttons for digits 0-9, decimal point, and basic operations (+, -, *, /)
Input and output display fields with labels
Handles division by zero

Why I made this:
I built this calculator to practice Java Swing and GUI development, and to create a simple, functional program that reinforces my understanding of basic arithmetic operations and event-driven programming.
